Hello!

I am Anxo, a Telecommunication Engineering student from Galicia, Spain. I
started to use free software, Ubuntu, a few months ago. Searching on the
Ubuntu Software Centre I found Pondus, a very usuful program. I use it a lot
because I'm trying to lose weight and I would like to translate this program
into Galician, a language similar to Portuguese, spoken in the north-west of
Spain. Is there any translation into Galician or Spanish? How can I do to
translate it? Can you send me the .po file?

I wait for your answer.

Anxo

Hello Anxo,

great that you like Pondus that you'd like to translate it, thanks a
lot for the offer!

You can always get the current version of the po files at
https://bitbucket.org/eike/pondus/src/tip/po/

As you can see there, a Spanish (Castilian) translation exists already,
but not a Galician one. Maybe you can use the Castilian one as a basis?
Then, you can send the po file to the mailing list.

Alternatively, you can also translate the current version online at
https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/pondus/resource/translations/

From there, I can automatically integrate the translations into the
source repository.

If you have further questions, don't hesitate to ask.

Thanks again and all the best from Germany,

Eike

Eike,

Great App! I love this program! It works great. It is just lacking one
thing that is much more important 
than a weight plan.

When paper hits the road, life gets messy, and I have painfully
discovered it is more important for the 
person to learn their body and how it operates as one changes things
around.

What I am suggesting is, you allow a person to attach ACTUAL EXPERIENCE
NOTES to each weigh-in, which 
allows the user to show what they did the day before that resulted in
the weigh-in results the next day. SO, 
If I weight 170 pounds (i wish) and I walked 2 miles and deviated from
my PLANNED DIET but eating three 
peices of Mushroom and Olive Pizza with a friend at 3:30 pm my and thus
gained 35 pounds (ugh!) I 
would make the following entry on the day after I weighted 170 lbs. on
the day that now shows 205 lbs as:

2 miles, ate 3 slices of Mushroom & Olive Pizza at 3:30, didn't eat
supper until 9 pm. Slept 8 hr


Now, maybe I might try eating that pizza earlier in the day next time,
or I might drop it entirely from my diet or I might decide to walk 6
miles if I eat that, etc. The point being, long after I have forgotten
what caused a jag on the chart, I may want to review for a pattern of
why I lost weight and why I gained weight and where I had to change my
diet to continue dropping in weight etc.

So, I am suggesting these notes be invisible in the chart, but when you
put your pointer on a dot on the chart it  
displays that weight and the note, if any was made. By keeping these
kind of notes on my paper chart I have learned how to maximize my weight
loss by knowing what I need to do, and I have learned what things to eat
earlier in the day and what to eat later in the day, or that I can no
longer eat. No two human bodies react the same way, nor do they level
the same weight and by knowing these things it is easier to speed up a
leveling process and get back to loosing weight.

The other thing is, it would be nice, but not as important as the first
suggestion, always have your beginning and ending weight and pounds lost
or gained print out on the chart, or at least your pounds lost or gained
total.

Thanks for a great app!
Terry

Hi Terry,

thanks a lot for the detailed comments and the suggestions, I am glad
you like this program!

I have actually thought about appending notes to weight entries before,
it will be included in the next release. The tooltips in the chart are
a great idea!

As soon as I find the time, I will implement this and then let you know
about it.

All the best,

Eike

Hi,


I'm the Fedora maintainer of Pondus.

There seems to be something wrong with Pondus on Fedora 15

Hi,

nice program, thanks for the work!
I have a feature request though, as I just bought a scale that measures the percentage of fat, water and muscles. So it would be great to enter and plot those data, too, which should be no problem to integrate into the current data structure (all hail xml ;)).
If you're short on time, implementing multiple users (as requested in June 2010: https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/pondus-dev/2010/000012.html) would allow for a workaround by adding three "users" and using each one for another value. You could even add "percentage" as an available dimension (besides metric and that deprecated system the americans use) and save that as a userspecific preference in the .xml file, just to have the proper dimensions on screen ^^

Well, until then, there's another workaround without the need to change anything, though you can't plot all four values side by side: Copy the user_data.xml file to, say, sven_gewicht.xml, sven_fett.xml and so on and call a script that takes one of these xml-files, renames it to user_data.xml, starts pondus and after pondus terminating re-renames it back to the original name. This is, of course, a workaround for the user feature as well, so if I should come to write that script, I'll post it here.

Either way, keep up the good work!

Bye, Sven

Hi Sven,

I actually implemented the possiblity of adding the percentage of
bodyfat in the development version.

https://bitbucket.org/eike/pondus/changesets

However, plotting the bodyfat (probably as a second y-axis) still needs
to be implemented (I have a draft version that needs improvement, since
I don't want to clutter the user interface in the plot dialog too much).
Once this is done I'll prepare a new release (and maybe even add
percentage of water and muscle as well).

Thanks a lot for the comments and the suggestions,

Eike

Message-ID: <1306748371.4561.1457502365@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hi all,

I just tagged the release candidate for pondus 0.8.0 containing the
following new features:

 * Add options to track bodyfat, muscle and water percentage (can be
   activated in preferences)
 * Add option to add notes to datasets (can be activated in preferences)
 * Plot bodyfat, muscle or water using second y-axis in graph
 * Set default plot range to "Last Year'' and replace "Last 3 months''
   with "Last 6 months''
 * Display bodyfat, muscle, water and notes as tooltips in main window

I plan to release the final version in a week or two, so now would be
the perfect time to update translations, test the new features or write
comments ;-)


1) translation updates

a) Just go to
   https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/pondus/resource/translations/
   and update the translation

or

b) Get the .po file from https://bitbucket.org/eike/pondus/src/tip/po/
   and send the updated file to me.


2) testing for bugs

Get the release candidate at https://bitbucket.org/eike/pondus/downloads
unpack the source and execute pondus.py. There is no need to permanently
install the release candidate.


Thanks a lot,

Eike
