<PRE>Eike,

Great App! I love this program! It works great. It is just lacking one
thing that is much more important 
than a weight plan.

When paper hits the road, life gets messy, and I have painfully
discovered it is more important for the 
person to learn their body and how it operates as one changes things
around.

What I am suggesting is, you allow a person to attach ACTUAL EXPERIENCE
NOTES to each weigh-in, which 
allows the user to show what they did the day before that resulted in
the weigh-in results the next day. SO, 
If I weight 170 pounds (i wish) and I walked 2 miles and deviated from
my PLANNED DIET but eating three 
peices of Mushroom and Olive Pizza with a friend at 3:30 pm my and thus
gained 35 pounds (ugh!) I 
would make the following entry on the day after I weighted 170 lbs. on
the day that now shows 205 lbs as:

2 miles, ate 3 slices of Mushroom &amp; Olive Pizza at 3:30, didn't eat
supper until 9 pm. Slept 8 hr


Now, maybe I might try eating that pizza earlier in the day next time,
or I might drop it entirely from my diet or I might decide to walk 6
miles if I eat that, etc. The point being, long after I have forgotten
what caused a jag on the chart, I may want to review for a pattern of
why I lost weight and why I gained weight and where I had to change my
diet to continue dropping in weight etc.

So, I am suggesting these notes be invisible in the chart, but when you
put your pointer on a dot on the chart it  
displays that weight and the note, if any was made. By keeping these
kind of notes on my paper chart I have learned how to maximize my weight
loss by knowing what I need to do, and I have learned what things to eat
earlier in the day and what to eat later in the day, or that I can no
longer eat. No two human bodies react the same way, nor do they level
the same weight and by knowing these things it is easier to speed up a
leveling process and get back to loosing weight.

The other thing is, it would be nice, but not as important as the first
suggestion, always have your beginning and ending weight and pounds lost
or gained print out on the chart, or at least your pounds lost or gained
total.

Thanks for a great app!
Terry
