<PRE>Hi Terry,

thanks a lot for the detailed comments and the suggestions, I am glad
you like this program!

I have actually thought about appending notes to weight entries before,
it will be included in the next release. The tooltips in the chart are
a great idea!

As soon as I find the time, I will implement this and then let you know
about it.

All the best,

Eike

</I>&gt;<i> Great App! I love this program! It works great. It is just lacking one
</I>&gt;<i> thing that is much more important 
</I>&gt;<i> than a weight plan.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When paper hits the road, life gets messy, and I have painfully
</I>&gt;<i> discovered it is more important for the 
</I>&gt;<i> person to learn their body and how it operates as one changes things
</I>&gt;<i> around.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I am suggesting is, you allow a person to attach ACTUAL
</I>&gt;<i> EXPERIENCE NOTES to each weigh-in, which 
</I>&gt;<i> allows the user to show what they did the day before that resulted in
</I>&gt;<i> the weigh-in results the next day. SO, 
</I>&gt;<i> If I weight 170 pounds (i wish) and I walked 2 miles and deviated from
</I>&gt;<i> my PLANNED DIET but eating three 
</I>&gt;<i> peices of Mushroom and Olive Pizza with a friend at 3:30 pm my and
</I>&gt;<i> thus gained 35 pounds (ugh!) I 
</I>&gt;<i> would make the following entry on the day after I weighted 170 lbs. on
</I>&gt;<i> the day that now shows 205 lbs as:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2 miles, ate 3 slices of Mushroom &amp; Olive Pizza at 3:30, didn't eat
</I>&gt;<i> supper until 9 pm. Slept 8 hr
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, maybe I might try eating that pizza earlier in the day next time,
</I>&gt;<i> or I might drop it entirely from my diet or I might decide to walk 6
</I>&gt;<i> miles if I eat that, etc. The point being, long after I have forgotten
</I>&gt;<i> what caused a jag on the chart, I may want to review for a pattern of
</I>&gt;<i> why I lost weight and why I gained weight and where I had to change my
</I>&gt;<i> diet to continue dropping in weight etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I am suggesting these notes be invisible in the chart, but when
</I>&gt;<i> you put your pointer on a dot on the chart it  
</I>&gt;<i> displays that weight and the note, if any was made. By keeping these
</I>&gt;<i> kind of notes on my paper chart I have learned how to maximize my
</I>&gt;<i> weight loss by knowing what I need to do, and I have learned what
</I>&gt;<i> things to eat earlier in the day and what to eat later in the day, or
</I>&gt;<i> that I can no longer eat. No two human bodies react the same way, nor
</I>&gt;<i> do they level the same weight and by knowing these things it is
</I>&gt;<i> easier to speed up a leveling process and get back to loosing weight.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing is, it would be nice, but not as important as the
</I>&gt;<i> first suggestion, always have your beginning and ending weight and
</I>&gt;<i> pounds lost or gained print out on the chart, or at least your pounds
</I>&gt;<i> lost or gained total.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for a great app!
</I>&gt;<i> Terry
