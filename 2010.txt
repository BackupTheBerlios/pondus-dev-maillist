Subject: [pondus-dev] translations via transifex
Message-ID: <20100316223040.299c45ff.eike@ephys.de>

Hi all,

from now on, translations can be added and modified via Transifex [1].
All changes will be committed automatically to the translations
repository [2].

Of course, contributing translations the 'old way', i.e. by sending .po
files to this mailing list is still possible as before.

Cheers,
Eike

Subject: [pondus-dev] Suggestion
Message-ID: <1277720996.1920.60.camel@juan-fnak>

Hello,

Thank you very much for the excellent free software Pondus. I'm sorry, I
don't speak english very well.

I have a suggestion. Today, it's not possible to have multiple users in
Pondus. We (my wife and myself) would like to use Pondus in the same
window in order to compare our weight evolution. Other users would be
interested in this feature.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.

Have a nice day.

Cordialy,

Juan Sorroche

Thanks a lot for the suggestion. Actually this idea has been proposed
several times now, so I will definitely include this feature in the
next major version of pondus (I don't have much time to code currently,
but there will be some occasions in the next few months, I hope).

I am thinking of the following:
 * The user whose data is displayed/entered/edited/ can be selected in
    the main window via a drop-down menu.
 * The weight evolution of different users can be compared graphically
    in a plot containing the weights of the users vs time.

Is that about what you were thinking of?

Thanks again for your comments,

Eike
